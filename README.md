# G2-E-sports-Networking
G2 E-sports a global E-sports conglomerate wants to expand into Bangladesh to enrich and diversify their already growing arsenal of promising E-sports professionals. The aim of G2 in Bangladesh is to not only search for talented E-sports players but, also build Lan Cafes all over Bangladesh to connect like-minded E-sports enthusiasts. G2 believes that Bangladesh has the potential to make it big in the global E-sports events of various games. Now, G2 will initially construct one Lan Cafes in the capital of six Divisions of Bangladesh, aside from these 6 Lan Cafes their will be two corporate offices in Dhaka and Chittagong which will be situated in the same building and network as the respective Lan Cafes. G2 is very sorry for not being able to establish Lan Cafes in the remaining two divisions due to lack of resources. Now they have selected me as their network engineer so, my task is to design and implement a network connection to connect the branches/Lan Cafes according to their requirements. In the following table the distance is given in kilometer between each branch and also their maximum capacity is mentioned in brackets beside the name of each branch.
